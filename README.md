# 👤 Facial Recognition-Based Gender & Age Prediction
This project uses facial images to classify **gender** and **predict age** using deep learning. It leverages datasets like **UTKFace** and **IMDb-WIKI**, and uses CNNs and transfer learning techniques.
---

##  Objective
Build a robust model that:
- Classifies **gender** (Male/Female)
- Predicts **age group** (Child/Teen/Adult/Senior)
- Can be extended for real-time applications like attendance based on facial recognition

## 📁 Dataset

### UTKFace
- 20k+ images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity.
- Format: `age_gender_ethnicity_date.jpg`
- [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)
