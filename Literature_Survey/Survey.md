- **Paper**: [ICCV 2015](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)
- **Summary**:
  - Utilized a pre-trained VGG-16 model and fine-tuned it for age estimation.
  - Treated age prediction as a regression task (expected value of softmax).
  - Trained on large-scale IMDb-WIKI dataset (~500k images).
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Label smoothing and expectation strategy led to better results.
  - Showed the power of transfer learning from classification to regression.

| Paper/Title                                         | Summary |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| "Lightweight CNN for Age/Gender Estimation" (2020) | Focus on mobile deployment and low-resource inference |
| "DeepFace for Age-Gender Classification" (Meta AI) | Combines detection, alignment, and classification in one pipeline |
| "Multitask Learning Approaches"                    | Joint training for age, gender, and emotion increases accuracy |

## Insights 

- UTKFace and IMDb-WIKI are great starting points for training and benchmarking.
- Transfer learning using MobileNet or VGGFace improves results.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing (face alignment, histogram equalization) matter a lot.
- Gender classification is easier than age prediction (binary vs regression/multi-class).
